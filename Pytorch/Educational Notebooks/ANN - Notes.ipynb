    "#### Perceptron Model to Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Biological Neuron and Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "Minsky 1969 - spawned the idea of Perceptrons - something that mimics the anatomy of the brain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multi inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum of all inputs * weights + a bias = output\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multi-layer perceptron Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Some network can approximate a function of any dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Deep Neural network = 2 or more hidden layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplify or compress outputs into single values that fall within a range b/w zero and one or -1 and 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we do not want an activation function for a particular layer as we need the output to output a number as close to its true state (weather temperature data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary classification ~ 0 or 1 ~ would require a step function\n",
    "Sigmoid Function ~ 0 to 1 ~ has a gadient slope that flattens towards the ends\n",
    "Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh) ~ outputs between -1 and 1 with similarity in shape to Sigmoid \n",
    "ReLU ~ less than 0 is zero higher than zero is the value inputted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax ~ probabilities for each class. The sum of all the probabilities is equal to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feed Forward Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error - Exponentially grows in cost ~ punishes large errors. \n",
    "~ keeps everything positive for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Function Parameters: \n",
    "1. W is the neural networks weights.\n",
    "2. B is the biases in the nn.\n",
    "3. S^r input of a single training example.\n",
    "4. E^r is the desired state of that training sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backpropogation\n",
    "\n",
    "(fill here)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One Hot Encoding (Multiclass Classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can organize multiple classes into matrices that assign values (1 or 0) depending on whether they fall under the category of the class. "
